# Introduction
The MNIST dataset consists data of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. Our project, S7, focuses on building a classifier that can accurately identify these digits using neural networks.

# Installation
To get started with S7, install the following dependencies:
1. torch
2. torchvision
3. torchsummary

Once dependecies are installed, follow the below:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the setup script.


# Usage
Once installed, you can easily use S7 to train and evaluate the neural network classifier. Here's how:

Load the MNIST dataset.
Configure the neural network architecture.
Train the model using the provided training script.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
